# Videouri

Source code for the CodeIgniter version, which was up until version 3.0

 - Checkout `dev` branch, install `bower` and `npm` dependencies from inside `boilerplate`
 - Duplicate `app/config/app_libraries.demo` to `app_libraries.php` and type in your credentials for the APIs.
 - Adjust settings in `app/config/config.php` according to your environment.
 - Have in mind, that this version of videouri uses [jimdoescode's youtube library](https://github.com/jimdoescode/CodeIgniter-YouTube-API-Library), which uses Youtube API V2 and is **deprecated**
